🧠 Idea (Very Easy Pattern)

You only need to remember the index of the last 1 you saw.
Whenever you find a new 1, check the distance from the previous one.

If the distance is ≤ k, return False.
If you finish scanning the array, return True.

✅ Clean Python Solution
class Solution(object):
    def kLengthApart(self, nums, k):
        last = -1  # Stores the index of the last seen 1
        
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            if v == 1:
                if last != -1 and i - last - 1 < k:  # distance between 1s is too small
                    return False
                last = i  # update last seen index
        return True

📌 Explanation

For each 1:

Check distance from previous 1

Distance is: i - last - 1

Must be at least k
→ so i - last - 1 >= k
→ or violation when i - last - 1 < k

🔍 Example Walkthrough

nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2

First 1 at index 0 → OK

Next 1 at index 4 → distance = 4 − 0 − 1 = 3 ≥ 2 → OK

Next 1 at index 7 → distance = 7 − 4 − 1 = 2 ≥ 2 → OK

Result → True
