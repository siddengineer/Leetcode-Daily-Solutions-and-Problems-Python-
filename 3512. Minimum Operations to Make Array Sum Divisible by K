🔍 Understanding the Problem

You want the sum of the array to be divisible by k.

Let:

sum = sum(nums)
rem = sum % k


If rem == 0 → answer = 0.

Else you must reduce sum using operations.

The only operation allowed:

nums[i] = nums[i] - 1   (one operation)


Each operation reduces total sum by 1.

So if sum % k = rem, then:

👉 You need rem operations.

Because after doing rem decrements, the new sum becomes divisible by k.

🎯 Key Insight
✔ Only sum matters, not individual elements

You do not need to think about which index to change.

Since every "−1" reduces total sum by 1, minimum operations needed is:

⭐ rem = sum(nums) % k

Unless all elements become negative?
🟢 No restriction — elements can become any number, even negative.
So this formula always works.

🧠 Final Formula
operations = sum(nums) % k


if remainder = 0 → return 0
else return remainder

✔ Example 1

nums = [3, 9, 7], k = 5
sum = 19
19 % 5 = 4
→ Need 4 operations

Matches output.

✔ Example 3

nums = [3,2], k = 6
sum = 5
5 % 6 = 5
→ Need 5 operations

Matches output.
