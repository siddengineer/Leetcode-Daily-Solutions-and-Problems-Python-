✅ Explanation:

You keep subtracting the smaller number from the larger one.

Each subtraction counts as one operation.

Stop when either number becomes 0.

Return the total number of operations performed.

Example:

sol = Solution()
print(sol.countOperations(2, 3))


Output:
3

Step-by-step:

(2,3) → 3−2 = 1 → (2,1)

(2,1) → 2−1 = 1 → (1,1)

(1,1) → 1−1 = 0 → (0,1)
→ Total operations = 3
