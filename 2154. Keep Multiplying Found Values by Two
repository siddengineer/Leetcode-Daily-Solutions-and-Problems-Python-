The logic is simple: keep checking if original is in nums. If it is, double it and continue; otherwise, return the value.

Here’s a clean solution:

class Solution(object):
    def findFinalValue(self, nums, original):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type original: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Convert nums to a set for faster lookup
        num_set = set(nums)
        
        # Keep multiplying while original is in the set
        while original in num_set:
            original *= 2
        
        return original


✅ Explanation:

Convert nums to a set for O(1) lookup instead of O(n) list search.

Use a while loop to check if original is in the set.

Multiply original by 2 every time it's found.

When it's no longer found, return it.

Example runs:

sol = Solution()
print(sol.findFinalValue([5,3,6,1,12], 3))  # Output: 24
print(sol.findFinalValue([2,7,9], 4))        # Output: 4
